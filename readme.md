## Intro

My attempt at making a tic tac toe game against a bot!
This was my first C++ project and it taught me alot of things. 
I had a lot of fun making this, and I hope you have the same playing.

## Requirements

Needs a c++ compiler to play.

## How To Play

- Clone the repository and run the hello.cpp file.
- Who starts (X) is randomly selected.
- To place a move, enter the row index and column index without spaces in between(starting from 0).

            00 | 01 | 02 
            ------------
            10 | 11 | 12
            ------------
            20 | 21 | 22

- Press enter.
- If you want to end the game early, type 'end' and press enter

## Thanks For Playing!
